# Sales-Data-Analysis-Project

# Overview

This project analyzes product sales and revenue data to gain insights into sales trends, product performance, and category-wise revenue distribution.

## Data

**Date:** Date of sale.

**Product ID:** Unique identifier for each product.

**Product Name:** Name of the product.

**Category:** Category the product belongs to (in this case: Electronics, Clothing).

**Units Sold:** Number of units sold on each date.

**Revenue:** Revenue generated from the sale of the product.

## SQL ANALYSIS


```sql
   SELECT  *  FROM   dbo.sales_data; 
```

####  1. Calculate Total Revenue by Product
```sql

SELECT   product_id,
         product_name,
         SUM(revenue) as Total_Revenue
FROM     dbo.sales_data
GROUP BY product_id,
         product_name
ORDER BY Total_Revenue DESC;
```
**Description:** Calculates the total revenue generated by a product

**Key Findings:** Smartphones generated the highest revenue  whilst T-shirts had the lowet revenue
